<u>***Suggestions***:</u> 

- [ ] Hourly data analysis seems necessary to determine weather patterns throughout the day. Analysis can focus on morning, noon and night categories; however this depends on raw data. 
- [ ] A monthly plot showing both temperature and precipitation would be super helpful. 
- [ ] Humidity data if available would be helpful to analyze and provide better results.
- [ ] It would be nice to see where the weather stations are located and how far they are with each other. This seems necessary to identify gaps and check the accuracy of analysis.
